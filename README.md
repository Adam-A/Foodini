## 1. Group Information
Team:

## 2. Design
The following are the planned designs of the various screens/views:
- Splash/loading screen
- Master shopping list screen
- Individual shopping list
- Add item to list view
- Pantry view
- BarCode scanning view
- Random recipe view
- Settings view

## 3. Libraries & APIs
### 3.1 Third Party Libraries
Most of the third party libraries and APIs we'll be relying on revolve around
accessing large databases of either foods or recipes. These are:
- Recipe & food database, found at [Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/).
- Food database with associated barcodes found at [Open food facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/).
- To make things look nice, various UI Design/Formatting cocoapods.
### 3.2 Native Libraries
- AVFoundation framework, used for real-time barcode scanning.

## 4. Server Support
To save the user's login and data, we will attempt to make use of iCloud for our
serialization--wherein the user account will simply use the user's apple ID.
However, if this becomes too much of a hassle, or is unreliable, we will
implement Google login and Firebase as our means of handling the login/signup
process and storing of user data. 

## 5. Models
The tentative outline of the models planned are a grocery list model and a
pantry model.
### 5.1 List Model
The list model will contain all data relevant to the shopping list. Including:
- Item struct 
- Name
- Expiration data
- Price
### 5.2 Pantry Model
The list model will contain all data relevant to the pantry. Including:
- Expiration date flagging
- The date the item was added

## 6. View Controllers
### 6.1 ShoppingListViewController
__Variables:__
- Table view containing list of shopping lists (serializable)

__View:__
- A table view containing a list of the grocery lists you have made
- An add list button (creates list that the user can rename)
- An edit list button (delete buttons pop up near list items)
- Buttons to navigate to the _PantryViewController_, _RecipesViewController_, and
the _SettingsViewController_

### 6.2 IndividualListViewController
__Delegates/Protocols:__
- When an item is marked off/purchased, update list of items the user has over
in the _PantryViewController_
- Deleting a list here will remove it from the list of shopping lists in the
_ShoppingListViewController_

__Variables:__
- Items to purchase, entered into table view
- Table view

__View:__
- Back button (returns user to _ShoppingListViewController_)
- Edit button to add items to the list (takes user to _AddItemViewController_)
- Table view of items

### 6.3 AddItemViewController
__Delegates/Protocols:__
- Items added/removed here are added or removed to/from the
_IndividualListViewController_/_PantryViewController_ tableview
- Populates items on this view controller from _IndividualListViewController_ or
from the _PantryViewController_

__Variables:__
- List of items on relevant grocery list

__View:__
- Done button (returns user to that specific _IndividualListViewController_)
- Back button (returns user to that specific _IndividualListViewController_)
- Custom keyboard with name of item and amount to purchase
- Scan barcode button (takes user to _BarcodeScannerViewController_)

### 6.4 PantryViewController
__Delegates/Protocols:__
- Items here are updated either manually or through _IndividualListViewController_
input

__Variables:__
- List of items in pantry
- Table view of items in pantry

__View:__
- Manual add button (takes user to a _AddItemViewController_ populated with with
items from the pantry)
- Buttons to navigate to the _ShoppingListViewController_, _RecipesViewController_,
and the _SettingsViewController_
- Table view containing the list of items in the pantry

### 6.5 RecipesViewController
__View:__
- Generate a random recipe when a button is pressed
- Buttons to navigate to the _PantryViewController_, _ShoppingListViewController_,
and the _SettingsViewController_

### 6.6 SettingsViewController
__Delegates/Protocols:__
- Update the settings that apply to the specific view controller

__View:__
- A few text labels with buttons for the different settings

### 6.7 BarcodeScannerViewController
__Delegates/Protocols:__
- Return relevant information to _AddItemViewController_

__Variables:__
- An Image or whatever information returns from the API call

__View:__
- Standard camera view stuff
- Data flow: (scan barcode) -> (retrieve item from openfoodsfactDB using barcode
match) -> (return food item name/info to user)

## 7. Week Long Tasks
### 7.1 Week 1
Set up main navigation and views.
### 7.2 Week 2
Implement barcode scanning and shopping list support, ensuring shopping list
serialization.
### 7.3 Week 3
Add pantry view and details, ensuring cross-view updates.
### 7.4 Week 4
Add recipe support if possible, hopefully base recipes off of what the user has
in their pantry.

## 8. Trello Board
The team's Trello board can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/KZggYtj1/master-189e-board).
## 9. Github Classroom
The team's Github classroom can be found [here](https://github.com/ECS189E/Can-I-graduate-already-LLC).
## 10. Testing Plan 
For the testing of the app, we determined that the testing group types could be
broken up as: 
- Holding focus groups (pizza supplied) to get people to try out the app
- Family, friend, classmate testing

The three (_more questions to come, surly_) basic questions to ask we concluded
were:
- rate the usefulness of the app
- rate the ease of use (signup/login and general use of the app)
- clarity of app purpose/use (gathered with or without prior instruction)

Lastly, the other miscellaneous things to keep an eye out for during testing
sessions are:
- user suggestions
- observations we make while users used app
