# Sprint Planning Meeting 1
### Summary
For this meeting, we whittled our API usage down to just the [Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/) API. 
We determined the barcode may be out of scope given the time frame, but needs
further investigation before completely ruling it out. Most of the view
controllers are on track with being completed (with basic functionality at least).
